WHAT IS IT?

This is a simple plugin for the Roundcube Webmail web application. It augments
the configured "product_name" shown to end users with a webserver's hostname
from a DNS perspective, i.e. through a reverse lookup of an interface's IPv4
address.

This is useful if you have more than one webserver that might reply to a
common service name and/or IP address shared among these webservers and you
want to enable users to identify which one in particular, e.g. to provide more
useful bug reports.

For example, you could have Roundcube's "product_name configured to be 
"example.com Webmail" and a HA proxy listening at "mail.example.com"
redirecting requests to either one of

  VM1    server1.example.com    eth0: 192.168.10.11
  VM2    server2.example.com    eth0: 192.168.10.12

Then this plugin (when running on server1) would lookup 192.168.10.11 in
the DNS, find "server1" in the DNS and change "product_name" to read
"example.com Webmail (server1)".

The reason the plugin does not simply use the locally configured hostname
is because there is another usage scenario that I use, A/B setups where
the locally configured hostname is identical.

For example, "mail.example.com" could point to 192.168.10.100 which is a
service IP address only configured on the active system:

  VM1    mail.example.com      eth0: 192.168.10.11 (in DNS as "server1")
                               eth0.1: 192.168.10.100 (in DNS as "mail")
  VM2    mail.example.com      eth0: 192.168.10.12 (in DNS as "server2")

In this scenario the locally configured hostname would always be "mail"
because both VMs at all times think that THEY are "mail" but external
knowledge in form of DNS actually decides which is the active one.


INSTALLATION

1. If you're not using "composer" to install the plugin: create a directory
   "plugins/webserver_rdns_lookup" in your Roundcube installation and copy
   all files there.
2. Inside that directory, copy "config.inc.php.dist" to "config.inc.php"
   and edit it. Change the $config['webserver_rdns_lookup_interface']
   variable to specify the name of the network interface whose primary
   IPv4 address should be used for the DNS lookup.
3. Add "webserver_rdns_lookup" to the $config['plugins'] array in
   Roundcube's own config/config.inc.php.
